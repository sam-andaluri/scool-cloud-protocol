# Classifying Cloud types using cloud vision APIs

NASA runs a citizen science project named Globe. This project consists of collecting data on Cloud and Land cover classification and mosquito habitats. My children participate in the cloud cover program. The solution for this born out of question from my 13 year old daughter: If a computer vision model can identify a cat or dog, can it identify a cloud tyoe by its shape?. To answer that question, together we set out on a journey to see how well the different cloud provider vision algorithms can identify the cloud cover. This led down a path to learn machine learning and computer vision. The following are complete solutions including a human-in-the-loop workflow for each of the three major cloud providers.
